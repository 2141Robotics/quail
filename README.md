Bird-brained swerve drive utility.

To use quail, you need a few things. The first is swerve modules. More than two. I don't care where your swerve modules are. They could be 52 miles apart and in the shape of a pentagon and quail would still work.

The second thing you need is a little knowledge of Java. You should be able to:
 - use a PID controller
 - use subclasses
 - make your motors spin

But, most importantly, you need a desire for freedom.

I wish I knew Kotlin so I could make it purple. ðŸ’œ

Currently quail is in early development so please report issues as you encounter them.
